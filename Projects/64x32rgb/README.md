# 64x32rgb

A China Railway (HSR and traditional) train tracker using a 64x32 RGB LED matrix.

It currently displays the start, current, and end stations, the company and if itâ€™s a regularly scheduled service, and a line diagram, but the APIs I use have much more data, e.g. the max occupancy of each car, and whether stations have luggage storage.
